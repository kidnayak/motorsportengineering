Open Source Knowledge for Motorsport Engineering and it's fundamentals.

Welcome to my research paper! I have started writing this paper as a high school student, so please forgive my use of simplistic language. I will be making this paper easy for beginners to understand, and hope this will prove to be valuable to high school and freshman college students who are interested in starting a career in motorsport engineering and itâ€™s sciences. I will be covering all important points we will need to try and extract maximum performance, efficiency and value for money on any project we pursue.

//This project is currently a work in progress. Stay tuned for commits and more updates.
